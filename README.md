Solving a location inventory routing disruption model using red deer algorithm


To run the Red Deer algorithm, use RDAlgorithm.py

To change RDA hyper parameters (except number of iterations which is defined on RDAlgorithm.py) use Population.py

To change the problem (the currect problem is location inventory routing disruptopn) you have to change the RedDeer.py and adjust it to your model

Link of the related paper will be added soon.
